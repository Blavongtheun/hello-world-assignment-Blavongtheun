Q: In what ways does GitHub help scientists follow the best practices for scientific computing?

GitHub, being an open source version control system provides many benefits to scientists and directly adresses many of the best practices for scientific computing. A prime benefit is the ability to do incremental changes to the code, editing branches and then comitting changes to the master files following a review of changes between the branch and master file. Additionally, the platform allows for comments along the way in both revision and pull requests. This feature allows for more clear documentation while also fostering collaboration. Overall, GitHub provides a platform that adresses many of the best practices, especially with respect to facillitating version control and collaboration.
